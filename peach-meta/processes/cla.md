# Contributor License Agreement

to contribute to ButtCloud, you must first sign a Contributor License Agreeement.

## why?

@ahdinosaur, the steward of ButtCloud, is committed to open source, at the moment all the code is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 copyleft licence.

but we don't the ButtCloud project to be locked in to a legacy license, when promising new licenses such as a [License Zero](http://licensezero.com/) explore new legal territories, where we may in the future want to move to a peer production, copyfarleft, or reciprocity license.

a Contributor License Agreement, as implemented here, allows contributors to grant a broad license to @ahdinosaur, the steward of ButtCloud.

## how?

once you contribute something significant, @ahdinosaur will contact you and setup a digital signature process using [HelloSign](https://hellosign.com).

the document to sign is [this Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11bR0SIPjCjdBLi-p-XZo2CBPBeguCdAS/view?usp=sharing).

after you sign, the document will be uploaded to a [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/4/folders/1BZ0JezJ_9DhJ2HgpoyDV4qirpjcAXIyi) for safe storage.
